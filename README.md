# 390 Principles of Programming Languages

This repository contains  assignments from my **390 Principles of Programming Languages** course. Throughout the course, I explored key programming language concepts, paradigms, and their practical applications.



## Languages Explored:

### 1. **Clojure**:
   - Functional programming.
   - Used Clojure to explore language design and models.

### 2. **Assembly Language**:
   - Low-level programming, focusing on direct hardware manipulation.
   - Gained experience with memory management, registers, and system-level operations.

### 3. **C Language**:
   - Focused on procedural programming and system-level programming.
   - Explored manual memory management, pointers, and low-level manipulation of data.

### 4. **C++**:
   - Object-oriented programming with an emphasis on classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Applied concepts such as memory management (via pointers) and object-oriented design.
