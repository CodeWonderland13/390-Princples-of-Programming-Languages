# 390 Princples of Programming Languages
This repository contains projects, assignments, and code samples from my 390 Principles of Programming Languages course. Throughout the course, I explored key programming language concepts, paradigms, and their practical applications. The course focused on understanding the design and implementation of programming languages, comparing language features, and using multiple languages to implement these principles.

Key Learning Outcomes:

1. Understanding of Programming Language Concepts:

Gained knowledge of syntax, semantics, and grammar of programming languages.


2. Exploring Different Paradigms:

Worked with functional, procedural, and object-oriented paradigms through various languages.


3. Language Implementation:

Learned how different languages are compiled and interpreted, including memory management, scope, and data types.


Languages Explored:

1. Clojure:

   
Functional programming with immutable data structures.
Used Clojure to explore Lisp-based language design and concurrency models.


2. Assembly Language:

   
Low-level programming, focusing on direct hardware manipulation.
Gained experience with memory management, registers, and system-level operations.


3. C Language:


Focused on procedural programming and system-level programming.
Explored manual memory management, pointers, and low-level manipulation of data.


4. C++:

   
Object-oriented programming with an emphasis on classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Applied concepts such as memory management (via pointers) and object-oriented design.
